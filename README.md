**Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow - Programming Assignments**

This repository contains the programming assignments from each week of the Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow course by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their application in image classification tasks.

### Week 1: Cats vs Dogs
- **Assignment:** Programming Assignment: Cats vs Dogs
- **Description:** In this assignment, you'll build a basic CNN model using TensorFlow to classify images of cats and dogs. This serves as an introduction to CNN architecture and image classification tasks.

### Week 2: Cats vs Dogs with Data Augmentation
- **Assignment:** Programming Assignment: Cats vs Dogs with Data Augmentation
- **Description:** This assignment builds upon the previous week's task by incorporating data augmentation techniques. You'll leverage TensorFlow and Keras to augment the Cats vs Dogs dataset, enhancing model generalization and preventing overfitting.

### Week 3: Transfer Learning - Horses vs Humans
- **Assignment:** Programming Assignment: Transfer Learning - Horses vs Humans
- **Description:** Transfer learning is a powerful technique that allows us to leverage pre-trained models for new tasks. In this assignment, you'll explore transfer learning using TensorFlow's pre-trained models to classify images of horses and humans.

### Week 4: Classification: Beyond Two Classes
- **Assignment:** Programming Assignment: Classification: Beyond two classes
- **Description:** Image classification tasks often extend beyond binary classification. In this assignment, you'll tackle multi-class classification problems using CNNs. You'll learn to handle datasets with more than two classes and design CNN architectures accordingly.
